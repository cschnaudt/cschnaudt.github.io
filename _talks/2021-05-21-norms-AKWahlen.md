Abstract:
Over the last two decades, scholars have investigated norms of citizenship by focusing primarily
on "dutiful" and "engaged" norms. In the meantime, contemporary democracies have witnessed
growing demands for more sustainable styles of living and increasing public support for
authoritarian and populist ideas. These developments point to both a change and an expansion
of conventional understandings and conceptions of what a 'good citizen' in a democratic polity
ought to do. Specifically, they raise questions about whether demands for more sustainability
and increasing support for populist ideas establish new facets of democratic citizenship, and if
so, how they can be meaningfully incorporated into existing images of citizenship. This study
provides a reconceptualization of citizenship norms and empirically tests a new measurement
instrument using original data collected in Germany in 2019. The empirical application of an
expanded set of items demonstrates the existence of more variegated facets of norms of
citizenship, including norms to safeguard a sustainable future and distinct populist facets
emphasizing the relevance of trust in authorities and experts as well as reliance on feelings and
emotions. Contemporary conceptions of citizenship thus go beyond conventional distinctions
between dutiful and engaged norms of citizenship.
