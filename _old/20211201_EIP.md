title: "A cross-national analysis on the behavioral implications of contextual-level electoral integrity and individual-level perceptions about the conduct of elections"
excerpt: "While recent research has provided valuable insights into measuring the integrity of elections and explaining citizens’ perceptions about the fairness of the electoral process, we still lack a clear understanding of the behavioral implications of electoral integrity. To date, only very few studies have investigated the relevance of electoral integrity for citizens’ political behavior, focusing mostly on turnout or voting for incumbent vs. opposition parties. Yet this rather limited focus neglects the breadth of citizens’ political action repertoires in modern democracies, including non-electoral behavior in the shape of institutionalized and non-institutionalized political participation. Against this background, the proposed study aims to shed light on this blind spot by investigating the (conditional) impact of (1) individual-level electoral-integrity beliefs and (2) country-level electoral integrity on different forms of citizens’ political behavior, namely turnout, vote choice, and non-electoral participation. In doing so, it strives to answer a new variant of an old question: Do violations of electoral integrity and individual doubts about the proper conduct of elections as (most) central institution of representative democracy induce citizens to opt for ‘exit’ (i.e., political apathy) or ‘voice’ (i.e., protest voting and participation beyond elections)?
At the (1) individual level, previous research shows that citizens are more likely to abstain from elections if they feel that the electoral process is rigged. Concerning vote choice, existing studies indicate that doubts about electoral integrity foster opposition voting, while coming at the expense of incumbent parties and candidates. Going beyond this government-opposition dichotomy, research in the broader area of political support indicates that dissatisfied citizens are more likely to engage in protest voting or to vote invalid. Therefore, citizens who doubt the integrity of elections might (also) raise their ‘voice’ by voting for protest parties or spoiling their vote. For non-electoral participation, we may expect doubts about electoral integrity to depress institutionalized participation, while fostering non-institutionalized participation aiming to circumvent the institutional structure and actors deemed responsible for electoral malpractices. Concerning the impact of (2) country-level electoral integrity, citizens should be less likely to participate in elections and to rely on institutionalized participation, while being more likely to make use of protest voting and non-institutionalized participation in countries with lower levels of electoral integrity. Finally, a micro-macro interaction is conceivable, with the impact of individual electoral-integrity beliefs on political behavior being amplified in contexts with lower electoral integrity. For the empirical test of the aforementioned propositions, we will rely on individual-level data from wave 7 of the World Values Survey (WVS), combined with country-level data on electoral integrity collected by the Electoral Integrity Project (EIP). The most recent wave of the WVS (2017-2020) contains an encompassing item battery for measuring citizens’ beliefs about the proper conduct of elections in their country. What is more, it provides a broad range of items pertaining to citizens’ political behavior, including (intended) voting behavior and vote choice as well as various forms of (institutionalized and non-institutionalized) non-electoral participation. For measuring electoral integrity at the country-level, we make use of the “Perceptions of Electoral Integrity” (PEI) dataset comprising information from expert surveys conducted by the EIP. Given the hierarchical structure of the resulting, combined dataset, with individual respondents nested in countries and explanatory variables at both the individual and country level, two-level hierarchical regression models will be estimated (including cross-level interactions for testing the conditional effects of individual electoral-integrity beliefs on political behavior as a function of country-level electoral integrity). To address the individual-level mechanisms linking electoral-integrity beliefs and political behavior more explicitly, an additional survey experiment could complement the empirical analysis."
