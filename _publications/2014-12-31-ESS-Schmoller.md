excerpt: 'The aim of this article is to provide a systematic overview and assessment of the contents, design and research potential of the ESS. To this end, the article outlines the contents of the first seven waves of the ESS, designates exemplary research designs and questions to be analysed with the individual- and contextual-level data provided by the ESS project, and provides information on how to obtain access to the ESS data. In addition, it highlights the methodology employed by the ESS, giving particular emphasis to questionnaire design and development, sampling procedures, as well as fieldwork, data collection, and data processing. To exemplify the practical implications and challenges of applying the ESS methodology, the article presents a detailed account of the contents and implementation of the ESS in Germany. It also contains information about additional resources connected with the ESS, such as the ESS EduNet online tutorials or the ESS Bibliography. The article concludes with a summary of the most important aspects of the ESS and highlights its research potential in comparison with other data sources.'
