excerpt: 'In this contribution, we break new ground in structural election forecasting. First, we spurn the dominant-government-versus-opposition paradigm and predict the performance of individual blocs. Although this approach is not new to the structural approach per se, our effort eschews any public-opinion measures. Second, and more innovatively, we focus exclusively on the undermined dimension of a country’s political history. Our model posits that vote share as a function of longer term—if not enduring—political structure variables have potency in predicting. These variables tap profound political events, such as German reunification, “grand-coalition” governance, party dominance in the Länder, and past party strength. This constellation of factors constitutes what we call a political-history model. Such a stance may seem bold until we recall that Germany represents a contemporary beacon of political stability. We demonstrate that this approach yields relatively sound estimates for the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU), Social Democratic Party (SPD), and All Others across 18 German Federal Elections over six decades.'
