excerpt: 'The country-specific, cumulative dataset for Germany is based on the official ESS cumulative data file (ESS1-6e01, edition 1) and combines the official German ESS data of the first seven waves in one single data set. It thus includes not only those items which have been fielded at least twice in the ESS, but all German data from 2002-2014. In addition, the data set includes further country-specific items for Germany which have not been integrated into one single, cumulative data set before. These country-specific items have only been asked in Germany but not in other participating countries in a given wave. They come in two different forms: Either they establish completely new variables (e.g., evaluation of oneâ€™s personal situation before and after German unification in 1990) or they add new data to variables which have previously been part of the ESS but only been repeated in Germany in a given wave (e.g., membership in a sports club in 2002 and 2006).
The country-specific, cumulative data set of the German ESS data thus represents an entirely new and encompassing collection of all available German ESS data from 2002-2014 which, in this form, has not been publicly available before. Relying on just one single data set allows for comprehensive data analyses without the need to switch between different data sets for individual ESS waves. The newly added country-specific items and data facilitate the analysis of new thematic focal points or enable researchers to investigate selected aspects of previous rotating modules also over time.'
