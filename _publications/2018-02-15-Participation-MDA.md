excerpt: 'In this article, we argue that, in order to arrive at meaningful conclusions about young and adult people’s political participation over time, ‘construct-equivalent’ rather than identical instruments of political participation across different age groups and time points should be used. Applying the so called ‘identity-equivalence procedure’ for political participation across three different age groups and the time period 2002-2014 using data from the European Social Survey (ESS), our results indicate that (1) the concrete manifestations of the concept of political participation differ across young and adult people and over time and (2) levels of political participation are quite similar for young and adult people and increasing from 2002-2014.'
