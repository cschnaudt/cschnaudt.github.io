excerpt: 'In a recently published article in this journal, R oss C ampbell argues that adherence to socialist values establishes a hitherto neglected factor when it comes to the explanation of differences in E ast and W est G erman citizens’ political trust. As the results of his study indicate, adherence to socialist values impacts negatively on citizens’ political trust, this effect is more pronounced and more stable over time for E ast G erman as compared to W est G erman citizens and is sufficiently strong to eliminate aggregate‐level differences in political trust between East and West G ermany. However, this research note suggests that C ampbell's article contains several substantial inconsistencies and obscurities that question the reliability and validity of the empirical findings presented. It provides a re‐analysis of Campbell's main arguments and shows to what extent his initial conclusions can be upheld after the shortcomings have been remedied. The results of this re‐analysis suggest that socialist values indeed exhibit a negative impact on G erman citizens’ political trust, which is relatively stronger for E ast as compared to W est G erman citizens. However, contrary to C ampbell's initial results, the negative effect of socialist values on political trust is robust over time for both E ast and W est G erman citizens. What is more, there is no empirical evidence confirming that differences in adherence to socialist values between E ast and W est G erman citizens are sufficiently strong to account for aggregate‐level differences in political trust. In light of these findings, two of C ampbell's three main conclusions are dubious and call for further examination.'
