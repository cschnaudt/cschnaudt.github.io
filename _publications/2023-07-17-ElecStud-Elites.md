excerpt: 'Elections in many democracies have come under attack "from within", with political elites challenging the integrity of the electoral process and calling its outcomes into question. Such allegations may delegitimize democratic outcomes and compromise citizens´ confidence in elections. Yet aside from their rhetoric, little is known about political elites´ electoral-integrity beliefs. This study breaks new ground by investigating how political elites perceive the integrity of elections, and which factors may account for differences in their electoral-integrity beliefs. Using innovative data from the 2021 candidate survey of the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES), the empirical analysis shows that political candidates exhibit mostly positive views about the integrity of the electoral procedures and the 2021 election, while being more skeptical about the fairness of the campaign period. Moreover, the findings show that negative campaign experiences, an affiliation with a populist political party, and electoral defeat are important drivers of candidates´ skepticism about the integrity of elections. These findings provide novel insights on the nature, background, and diagnostic significance of political elites´ electoral-integrity beliefs in modern democracies.'
