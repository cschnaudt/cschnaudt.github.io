title: "Immigration as ‚flash issue‘: How the refugee crisis has altered electoral behavior in Europe"
excerpt: "Immigration touches upon emotionally charged questions of identity and has the potential to transform the political landscape. When it comes to support for far-right parties, citizens’ attitudes towards immigration have been identified as a key explanatory factor. However, while support for far-right parties has increased in many European countries over the last two decades, citizens’ immigration attitudes have remained rather stable within and across European countries. In this paper, we argue that, even though immigration attitudes might not have changed much within European countries, the salience of immigration as politically contested issue has increased. We contend that with increasing importance of immigration as a political issue, citizens’ immigration attitudes are more likely to transform into politically tangible attitudes and behavior, such as feeling close to or voting for far-right parties. Using longitudinal ESS data combined with CHES data on cabinet positions on the immigration issue, we show that in the period 2002-2016 the effects of citizens’ immigration preferences and evaluations, as well as the deviation to the right from the government’s position on immigration become stronger. Accordingly, while immigration attitudes among European publics have not turned more negative over time, they have become more influential in citizens’ decision calculus regarding which parties they feel closest to or which parties they consider a suitable vote choice.

(This is joint work with Christian Stecker, MZES, Mannheim.)"
