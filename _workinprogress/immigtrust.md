title: "Varieties of trust and the politicization of immigration"
excerpt: "Who do you need to trust in order to favor diversity and immigration? Previous research suggests that social trust in others establishes a key resource of any well-functioning society, especially as communities get more diverse and social cohesion is put under pressure. In this paper, however, we argue that once diversity develops into a politicized issue, it is political trust in those who shape immigration policies rather than social trust in people in general that will be(come) more influential in forming individuals’ immigration attitudes. We test this argument about the conditional role of social and political trust depending on the politicization of immigration in two complementary ways: First, relying on a longitudinal cross-sectional design using data from the European Social Survey (ESS) covering 25 countries over the period 2002-2016, we show that the (relative) impact of political vis-à-vis social trust on individuals’ immigration attitudes is more pronounced in contexts where immigration is salient. Second, relying on panel data from the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) for the period 2013-2017, we provide a detailed assessment of the relevant individual-level mechanisms and demonstrate that the impact of political trust on immigration attitudes varies with the importance individuals ascribe to the immigration issue. In addition, we trace the politicization of the immigration issue and the refugee crisis in the media and show that political trust is more relevant for immigration attitudes when immigration features in the media. Our findings provide important insights concerning the societal and political sources of social cohesion in times of increasing immigration and diversity.

Who do you need to trust in order to favor diversity and immigration? Previous research suggests that social trust in others establishes a key resource of any well-functioning society, especially as communities get more diverse and social cohesion is put under pressure. In this paper, however, we argue that once diversity develops into a politicized issue, it is political trust in those who shape immigration policies rather than social trust in people in general that will be(come) more influential in forming individuals’ immigration attitudes. We test this argument about the conditional role of social and political trust depending on the politicization of immigration in two complementary ways: First, relying on a longitudinal cross-sectional design using data from the European Social Survey (ESS) covering 25 countries over the period 2002-2016, we show that the (relative) impact of political vis-à-vis social trust on individuals’ immigration attitudes is more pronounced in contexts where immigration is salient. Second, relying on panel data from the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) for the period 2013-2017, we provide a detailed assessment of the relevant individual-level mechanisms and demonstrate that the impact of political trust on immigration attitudes varies with the importance individuals ascribe to the immigration issue.
