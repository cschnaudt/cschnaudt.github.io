title: "Exit or voice? Behavioral implications of electoral-integrity beliefs in Germany"
excerpt: "Free and fair elections are the cornerstone of representative democracy. In recent years, however, elections in many advanced democracies have increasingly come under attack by populist actors and rhetoric questioning the integrity of the electoral process. While scholarly attention has so far largely focused on expert surveys measuring and documenting the integrity of different elections, a thorough and encompassing understanding of citizens’ electoral-integrity perceptions is still lacking. This shortcoming particularly applies to the study of the behavioral implications of citizens’ electoral-integrity beliefs. Against this background, the aim of the present study is to shed light on this blind spot in the scholarly literature by investigating the impact of electoral-integrity beliefs on citizens’ political behavior in Germany. Specifically, the study aims to assess the impact of electoral-integrity perceptions on turnout, vote choice, as well as non-electoral (institutionalized and non-institutionalized) political participation. The study’s (preregistered) empirical analysis will be based on the pre-election survey of the 2021 German Longitudinal Election Study. Its findings will provide novel insights on the behavioral implications of electoral-integrity beliefs and extend the (scarce) findings of previous research to (1) a broader political action repertoire as well as (2) the German context. The empirical evidence generated comes with far-reaching implications for the general viability of modern democracies, as it sheds light on a new variant of an old question: Do citizens who question the integrity of elections as (most) central institution of representative democracy opt for exit or voice?
