title: "Quality of government, perceptions of distributive and procedural fairness, and two types of political trust"
excerpt: "Quality of government, the impartial exercise of government authority by political institutions and authorities, has been regularly portrayed as one of the most important drivers of citizens’ political trust. Numerous studies show that violations of the impartiality principle, such as rampant inequality or corruption, exert a sizable detrimental effect on citizens’ trust in political institutions, thus posing a challenge to the social cohesion and long-term political stability of modern societies. At the same time, however, previous research is characterized by at least two blind spots. First, most of what is known about the relationship between quality of government and political trust is based on macro-level indicators of the impartiality principle, neglecting the role and relevance of citizens’ subjective fairness perceptions when it comes to explaining trust in political institutions. Second, most existing studies rely on a one-dimensional conception of political trust, implicitly assuming that the link between quality of government and political trust operates identically for different (types of) institutions and authorities. Against this background, the aim of the present study is to shed more light on the (conditional) interplay between macro-level indicators of quality of government, subjective perceptions of distributive and procedural fairness, and citizens’ trust in representative and regulative institutions. Relying on distributive and procedural justice theory as well as theoretical accounts on responsibility attribution, we put forward and empirically test four propositions. First, we posit that citizens with more positive perceptions of distributive and procedural fairness show higher levels of political trust. Second, we argue that the relative importance of distributive and procedural fairness perceptions as antecedents of political trust varies between representative and regulative institutions. We expect distributive fairness perceptions to be more relevant with regard to trust in representative institutions, while perceptions of procedural fairness should be more important for trust in regulative institutions. Third, we posit that in contexts where the quality of government is high, citizens exhibit higher levels of political trust. Fourth, we argue that the impact of subjective perceptions of distributive and procedural fairness on political trust is contingent on the macro-level quality of government. We expect the impact of subjective perceptions to be stronger in contexts with higher quality of government. We test these propositions by means of hierarchical regression models using data from the ninth round of the European Social Survey (ESS) collected in 2018/19. The ninth round of the ESS includes a specific thematic module on “Justice and fairness”, allowing for an encompassing empirical test of the propositions specified based on more than 40,000 respondents from a total of 27 European countries. Overall, the findings of our study provide a more nuanced theoretical and empirical picture on the interplay between quality of government and political trust than previous research, highlighting the central role of subjective fairness perceptions and the need to distinguish between different types of institutions as objects of citizens’ political trust.
