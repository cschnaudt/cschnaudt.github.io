title: "Different modes, different conclusions? Implications of survey-mode choice on inferences in the area of political support"
excerpt: "Most comparisons between self-administered and interviewer-administered surveys focus on an assessment of methodologically relevant survey quality indicators, such as representativeness, response rates, the occurrence of straightlining, or the number of refusals and “don’t knows” given by respondents. Yet, when facing a decision on whether to implement a survey by face-to-face, web, or mail, researchers are first and foremost interested in the possible effects of mode choice on the substantive conclusions they can reach from their analysis. While in general data quality has been shown to be higher in face-to-face surveys, conducting interviewer-administered surveys is becoming more and more expensive in many countries as response rates are on decline and the duration of fieldwork continually increases.
In times in which survey costs thus become an increasingly relevant factor in conducting empirical social science research, investigating the substantive effects of different survey modes is a major concern not only for survey researchers. However, researchers only rarely have the opportunity to investigate and directly compare the impact of different survey modes on the substantive results of their empirical analyses. The most recent wave of the European Values Study (EVS) in Germany provides such an opportunity to study these differences in an experimental design. Relying on a probabilistic sample of the general population, the EVS in Germany has been conducted in three different ways, namely as a face-to-face survey, as a mixed-mode survey (web and mail), and as a mixed-mode survey using a matrix design. This experimental setup allows us to test whether the substantive conclusions from several multivariate models in three distinct social science research areas (political support, political participation, democratic norms and values) vary across survey modes. By comparing our findings for three main pillars of social science research (attitudes, behavior, norms and values) across three different data collection modes (face-to-face, web, mail), our analysis thus provides important insights into the implications of survey mode choice on the substantive conclusions reached from empirical analyses in the areas of political support, political participation, and democratic norms and values.
