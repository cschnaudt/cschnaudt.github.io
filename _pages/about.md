I am a Postdoctoral Researcher and Lecturer at the [Chair of Political Science - Political Sociology](https://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/en/schmitt-beck/){:target="_ blank"} at the [Department of Political Science](https://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/en/research/political-science/){:target="_ blank"}, [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/){:target="_ blank"}, Germany. **From 1 October 2022 to 31 March 2023, I act as an Interim Professor for Empirical-Analytical Participation Research at the [Institute of Political Science](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/politikwissenschaften/){:target="_ blank"}, [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en){:target="_ blank"}, Germany.**

Prior to that, I have been working as a Senior Researcher and Project Manager of the [European Social Survey](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/){:target="_ blank"} Germany at [GESIS -- Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences](https://www.gesis.org){:target="_ blank"} and as a Research Associate at the [University of Bielefeld](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/(en)/soz/){:target="_ blank"} and the [Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES)](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/d7/en){:target="_ blank"}. In addition, I have been a Visiting Fellow at the [Department of Political Science and Research Methods](https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/omd/){:target="_ blank"} at the University of Twente, The Netherlands, as well as at the [Institute of Sociology](https://www.soc.cas.cz/en/about-institute){:target="_ blank"} of the Czech Academy of Sciences.

My [research](https://cschnaudt.github.io/publications/) and [teaching](https://cschnaudt.github.io/teaching/) activities are located in the broader areas of political behavior, comparative politics, [survey methodology](https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfab039){:target="_ blank"}, and [quantitative methods](https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-30237-5_7){:target="_ blank"}.  
I study the causes and consequences of citizens' political attitudes and behaviors in modern democracies, paying particular attention to the relevance of the context in which citizens are embedded. Specifically, I am interested in topics such as [political confidence and trust](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319894317){:target="_ blank"}, [(perceptions of) electoral integrity](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-022-00403-9){:target="_ blank"}, [political participation](https://doi.org/10.12758/mda.2017.12){:target="_ blank"}, [political sophistication](https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-30492-8_5){:target="_ blank"}, as well as [democratic norms and values](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F02633957211031799){:target="_ blank"}.
