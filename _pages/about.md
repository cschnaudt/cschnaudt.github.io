I am a Postdoctoral Researcher and Lecturer at the [Department of Political Science](https://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/en/research/political-science/), [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/), Germany.

My research and teaching activities are located in the broader areas of political behavior, comparative politics, survey methodology, and quantitative methods. I study the causes and consequences of citizens' political attitudes and behaviors in contemporary democracies, paying particular attention to topics such as [political trust](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319894317), political participation, as well as democratic norms and values.
