I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES)](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/d7/en){:target="_ blank"}, [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/){:target="_ blank"}, Germany.

Previously, I acted as interim Professor for Empirical-Analytical Participation Research at the [Institute of Political Science](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/politikwissenschaften/){:target="_ blank"}, [University of Heidelberg](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en){:target="_ blank"}, and held different positions as a Lecturer at the [Department of Political Science](https://www.sowi.uni-mannheim.de/en/research/political-science/){:target="_ blank"}, [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/){:target="_ blank"}. In the past, I also worked as a Senior Researcher and Project Manager of the [European Social Survey](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/){:target="_ blank"} Germany at [GESIS -- Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences](https://www.gesis.org){:target="_ blank"} and was a Research Associate at the [University of Bielefeld](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/(en)/soz/){:target="_ blank"}. In addition, I have been a Visiting Fellow at the Department of Political Science and Research Methods at the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/){:target="_ blank"}, The Netherlands, as well as at the Institute of Sociology of the [Czech Academy of Sciences](https://www.avcr.cz/en/){:target="_ blank"}.

My [research](https://cschnaudt.github.io/publications/) and [teaching](https://cschnaudt.github.io/teaching/) activities are located in the broader areas of political behavior, comparative politics, [survey methodology](https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfab039){:target="_ blank"}, and [quantitative methods](https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-30237-5_7){:target="_ blank"}.  
I study the causes and consequences of citizens' political attitudes and behaviors in modern democracies, paying particular attention to the relevance of the context in which citizens are embedded. My current research agenda focuses on the role and relevance of (perceptions of) electoral integrity in contemporary democracies, analyzing the determinants of [citizens'](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379423000331){:target="_ blank"} and [political elites'](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379423000768){:target="_ blank"} views about the fairness of elections, and in what ways such views matter for [political behavior](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11615-022-00403-9){:target="_ blank"} and other civic virtues across different [political contexts](https://doi.org/10.5771/9783748915553-485){:target="_ blank"}.  Moreover, I am interested in topics such as [political confidence and trust](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319894317){:target="_ blank"}, [political participation](https://doi.org/10.12758/mda.2017.12){:target="_ blank"} and [voting behavior](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ijpor/edac034){:target="_ blank"}, [political sophistication](https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-30492-8_5){:target="_ blank"}, as well as [democratic norms and values](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F02633957211031799){:target="_ blank"}.
